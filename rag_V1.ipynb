        "Description:\n",
        "This complete, end-to-end tutorial demonstrates how to create an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Groclake. The process involves managing documents in DataLake, generating vectors for documents, performing vector searches, enriching search results, and utilizing ModelLake to provide contextual, AI-assisted responses. Each step is designed to showcase the capabilities of Groclake in creating a fully functional Agentic RAG system.\n",
